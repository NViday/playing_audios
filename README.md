#Matlab code
      read audios' filename from a text file and play them .
      Example of reading text file line per line 
      
#Matlab funtion 
      input is a string ( the text file name)
      output is 0 ( no matter what the input is) 
      
      #be careful !!!
           There are no security checking 
           
           So, 
           
               String needs to correpond to an existing file (in the current working directory)
               textfile must contain audios filename only
